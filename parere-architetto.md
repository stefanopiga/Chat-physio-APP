Summary

Project uses Vite + React 19 + React Router 7 + Tailwind CSS v4 + Radix/Shadcn-style UI + Recharts + Supabase JS v2.
Story 4.2.4 shifts feedback to DB; frontend remains backward-compatible, but FE architecture doc should align with actual stack/versions.
Given major-version deltas (React 19, Router 7, Tailwind v4), integrating official sources is recommended to avoid drift and lock patterns.

Current Front-End Stack (from repo)

Framework: React ^19.1.1, Vite ^5.4.20 (apps/web/package.json:1)
Routing: React Router DOM ^7.8.2 (apps/web/package.json:1), routes in apps/web/src/App.tsx:1
Styling: Tailwind CSS ^4.1.13 with @tailwindcss/vite plugin (apps/web/vite.config.ts:1, apps/web/src/index.css:1)
UI: Radix primitives + Shadcn-style components (apps/web/src/components/ui/*)
Charts: Recharts ^3.2.1 (apps/web/package.json:1, used in apps/web/src/pages/AnalyticsPage.tsx:1)
Auth/API: Supabase JS ^2.57.4 (apps/web/src/lib/supabaseClient.ts:1), custom token refresh in apps/web/src/lib/apiClient.ts:1
Testing: Vitest + Testing Library; E2E with Playwright (apps/web/package.json:1)
Gaps vs. Internal Docs

Tech stack doc lists React ~18 and Zustand, but repo uses React 19 and no global state lib (docs/architecture/sezione-3-tech-stack.md:1).
Addenda cover Tailwind v4 and Recharts well; React Router 7 and React 19 aren’t explicitly referenced.
Env guidance for Vite VITE_* is present as a template (apps/web/ENV_WEB_TEMPLATE.txt:1) but not consolidated into a FE architecture doc section.
Official Sources To Integrate (recommended)

React 19: https://react.dev (current docs and 19 notes)
React Router 7: https://reactrouter.com (v7 routing patterns and APIs)
Vite 5: https://vite.dev (env and alias: Env and Modes; resolve.alias)
Tailwind CSS v4: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation (Vite + @tailwindcss/vite + @import flow)
Supabase JS v2: https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript (auth sessions, token refresh behavior)
Recharts: https://recharts.org (composition, responsiveness, accessibility)
Shadcn UI: https://ui.shadcn.com (component usage patterns)
Radix UI: https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs (accessibility primitives)
Vitest/Testing Library/Playwright: https://vitest.dev, https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro, https://playwright.dev/docs/intro
Why integration is necessary

Major versions introduced breaking/behavior changes (Router 7, Tailwind 4) not fully covered by internal docs; official references reduce ambiguity for future changes.
Architecture template expects stack, routing, API clients, styling, testing, and env patterns; aligning each with current official guidance prevents “cargo culting” and keeps AI/dev agents on spec.
QA risks call out performance and security; official docs for Supabase auth and Tailwind v4 build setup help harden those areas.
How to map into the template

Template/Framework Selection: document “Existing Vite + React 19 + Router 7 + Tailwind 4” with links to Vite/Tailwind installation and Router 7 overview (.bmad-core/templates/front-end-architecture-tmpl.yaml:1).
Frontend Tech Stack table: populate using actual versions from apps/web/package.json:1.
Project Structure: reflect src/components, src/pages, src/lib, guards, and alias @ (apps/web/vite.config.ts:1, apps/web/tsconfig.json:1).
API Integration: show apiClient pattern with token refresh and Vite env usage (apps/web/src/lib/apiClient.ts:1, apps/web/src/lib/supabaseClient.ts:1) + link Vite env docs.
Routing: show BrowserRouter/Routes/Route usage and guard pattern (apps/web/src/App.tsx:1) + Router 7 docs link.
Styling Guidelines: Tailwind v4 usage and Radix/Shadcn references (apps/web/src/index.css:1 + addenda).
Testing Requirements: Vitest, Testing Library, Playwright with links and minimal templates.
Environment Configuration: consolidate VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, VITE_API_BASE_URL (apps/web/ENV_WEB_TEMPLATE.txt:1).
Recommendation

Integrate official sources for React 19, React Router 7, Vite env/alias, Tailwind v4, Supabase JS v2, Recharts, and Shadcn/Radix into the new frontend architecture doc. This is advisable (not optional) due to version shifts and to ground the template sections in authoritative references.
Also correct the outdated stack entries (React 18/Zustand) when generating the doc.
Next Actions

Do you want me to generate docs/ui-architecture.md from the template with:
Updated stack table from apps/web/package.json
Routing, API, styling, testing, env sections pre-filled from code
A “References” subsection per section with the official links above?
Optional: update docs/architecture/sezione-3-tech-stack.md to match actual FE versions, or cross-link it from the new doc to keep a single source of truth.
