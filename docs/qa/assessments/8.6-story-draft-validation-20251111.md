# PO Validation: Story 8.6 — README Scripts Refinement (Windows)

Date: 2025-11-11
Validator: Sarah (Product Owner)
Story: docs/stories/8.6-readme-scripts-refinement.md

## Summary

The draft is well-structured, actionable, and tightly scoped to documentation hardening for Windows users. Acceptance Criteria are concrete and testable, with strong security requirements (per-session execution policy, placeholders, secret scanning). Minor clarifications and a couple of explicit cross-links will improve implementability and reduce ambiguity.

Final Assessment: GO (with minor edits)
Implementation Readiness Score: 8/10
Confidence Level: High

## Template Compliance Issues

- Story includes: Status, Priority, Effort, Epic, Dependencies, Story, Acceptance Criteria, Tasks/Subtasks. Sufficient for this documentation-focused change.
- No obvious placeholder remnants. Some emoji artifacts show encoding issues in text; recommend replacing with ASCII callouts for cross-platform readability.
- Suggest adding a brief “Validation Evidence” section placeholder to collect outputs and confirmations after edits (optional but useful).

## Critical Issues (Must Fix - Story Blocked)

- None blocking. Scope, ACs, and tasks are clear and independently actionable.

## Should-Fix Issues (Important Quality Improvements)

- Add cross-reference to scripts/README.md at the top of the story to anchor implementers to the primary target document.
- AC2/Task 2: Explicitly require capturing expected outputs (short snippets) for cmd vs PowerShell where different, and store them in scripts/README.md to aid regression checks.
- AC6: Add link targets for the listed troubleshooting docs that are known to exist (Docker, infra, db connectivity) to prevent broken-link churn during editing.
- AC8: Replace or mirror emoji-based warnings with ASCII text (e.g., “Security Warning”, “Test environment only”) to avoid rendering/encoding issues on some terminals.

## Nice-to-Have Improvements (Optional Enhancements)

- Consider adding a small CI check to validate doc/FS parity (AC1) automatically (e.g., script that diffs scripts/ tree against anchors in README) to prevent future drift.
- Provide a short Windows PATH configuration mini-guide snippet in Prerequisites (common pitfalls for Python/Poetry).
- Where feasible, prefer single-source code blocks that show both cmd and PowerShell lines together for quick comparison.

## Acceptance Criteria Satisfaction Assessment

- AC1 (Documentation completeness): Clear, with a concrete audit task; recommend an output artifact (coverage checklist file) location, e.g., scripts/docs-coverage-8.6.md.
- AC2 (Windows-native commands): Clear and testable; ensure equivalents exist or are explicitly WSL-only. Capture expected outputs to avoid regressions.
- AC3 (Prerequisites): Clear; include official links and PATH notes.
- AC4 (Env vars): Clear; enforce placeholders and link .env.example and guidance doc.
- AC5 (Examples): Clear; ensure real project paths and expected outputs included.
- AC6 (Troubleshooting): Clear; tie to existing docs with links.
- AC7 (Cross-platform notes): Clear; explicit WSL/Git Bash markers.
- AC8 (Security & Safety): Clear; per-session Bypass only, placeholders, secret scanning note, TEST-ONLY warnings, least-privilege admin usage.

Conclusion: ACs are implementable and measurable.

## Validation and Testing Instructions Review

- Testing approach: Focus on hands-on verification across cmd and PowerShell, with output capture and Windows-specific troubleshooting. Good.
- Tools: Poetry, pnpm (optional), Docker; plus secret scanning via Bash/WSL. Consider noting minimum Windows version explicitly (Windows 10+ already present) and PowerShell 5.1+.
- Test data: Use placeholder-only .env, localhost endpoints, and disposable resources.

## Security Considerations Assessment

- Strong emphasis on per-session execution policy and secret hygiene. Explicitly forbid global policy changes; good.
- Recommend adding a one-liner stating: “Never display real tokens or credentials in screenshots or terminal captures included in docs.”

## Tasks/Subtasks Sequence Validation

- Order is logical: audit → verify commands (cmd, PowerShell) → prerequisites → env vars → examples → troubleshooting. Dependencies and scope are clear.
- Suggest adding “commit checklist artifacts and updated README” as final subtask to close the loop.

## Anti-Hallucination Findings

- References align with existing files: scripts directory structure, .env.example, ISTRUZIONI-USO-VARIABILI-AMBIENTE.md, and troubleshooting docs.
- No invented tools/processes detected. Secret scanning script exists under scripts/security/ and is correctly called out as Bash-only/WSL on Windows.

## Actionable Edits (Ready to Apply)

1) Replace emoji-based warning markers with ASCII headings, e.g., “Security Warning” and “Test environment only”.
2) Add explicit expected-output snippets for at least one example per script in cmd and PowerShell.
3) Add links to existing troubleshooting docs under docs/troubleshooting for Docker, infra, and database connectivity.
4) Add a destination for the documentation coverage checklist artifact (e.g., scripts/docs-coverage-8.6.md).
5) Add a final subtask to commit updated README and artifacts, and to run secret scanning as a pre-merge verification step.
