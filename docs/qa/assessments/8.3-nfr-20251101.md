# NFR Assessment: 8.3 — Deep Review Secondary READMEs

Date: 2025-11-01
Reviewer: Quinn (QA)
Story: docs/stories/8.3-deep-review-secondary-readmes.md

---

## Summary

- Security: PASS — ACs enforce no secrets, placeholders only, and secret management notes.
- Reliability: PASS — Story requires link validation, cross-references, and consistency checks across CI/compose/.gitignore.
- Maintainability: PASS — AC5 mandates formatting standards, coherent structure, and language style; tasks ensure durable documentation.

Scope note: Performance is not applicable for this documentation-focused story and is intentionally not assessed.

---

## Evidence Reviewed

- Story ACs (AC1–AC5) covering CI/CD links, compose alignment, .gitignore compliance, cross-referencing, and quality standards.
- Repo presence of referenced artifacts: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.gitignore` (all exist).
- Dev Notes include validation commands and explicit compliance requirements.

---

## Critical Issues

- None. The story defines verifiable documentation outcomes that support NFRs.

---

## Quick Wins

- Add an explicit UTF-8 encoding note to the update steps to prevent mojibake in docs.
- Optionally provide a one-liner link checker example for Linux/macOS and PowerShell to standardize validation.
