# NFR Assessment: 2.12

Date: 2025-10-17
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: CONCERNS - No explicit rate limiting or auth posture review in scope; secrets handled via Settings
- Performance: CONCERNS - No response time targets; perf impact of model config not measured
- Reliability: CONCERNS - Tests exist, but no health checks/circuit breakers evidence; DI improves controllability
- Maintainability: PASS - Centralized LLM config, env-driven, tests and docs updates improve maintainability

## Critical Issues

1. Missing explicit performance targets (Performance)
   - Risk: Unbounded latency regressions
   - Fix: Define API p95 targets (e.g., <300ms chat route) and add lightweight perf check

2. No rate limiting evidence (Security)
   - Risk: Brute-force/abuse risk on chat endpoints
   - Fix: Add rate limiting middleware and security section reference in architecture

## Quick Wins

- Add p95 latency SLO for chat/classification and monitor
- Add simple rate limiting to public/chat endpoints
- Add health check and basic circuit breaker guidance

## Evidence

- Story: docs/stories/2.12.gpt-5-nano-integration.md
- Config centralization via Settings with env overrides (AC1)
- Tests planned/updated for config usage (AC5)
