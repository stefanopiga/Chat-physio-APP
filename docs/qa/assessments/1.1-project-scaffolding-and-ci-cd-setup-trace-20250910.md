# Requirements Traceability Matrix

## Story: 1.1 - Project Scaffolding & CI/CD Setup

### Coverage Summary

- Total Requirements (ACs): 5
- Fully Covered by Tasks: 5 (100%)
- Partially Covered: 0 (0%)
- Not Covered: 0 (0%)

This matrix confirms that the development plan, as outlined in the Tasks/Subtasks section, provides full coverage for all acceptance criteria.

### Requirement Mappings

#### AC1: The Monorepo is created with the `frontend` and `backend` directories.

**Coverage: FULL**

*   **Task Mapping**: `Setup Monorepo e Struttura Progetto (AC: 1)`
    *   **Given**: An empty project repository.
    *   **When**: The developer executes the subtasks for initializing Git, creating the directory structure, and setting up pnpm workspaces.
    *   **Then**: The monorepo structure with `apps/web`, `apps/api`, etc., will exist, fulfilling the requirement.

#### AC2: A `docker-compose.yml` file correctly starts the frontend and backend services for local development.

**Coverage: FULL**

*   **Task Mapping**: `Configurazione Ambiente di Sviluppo Docker (AC: 2)`
    *   **Given**: The frontend and backend applications have been initialized.
    *   **When**: The developer creates the `Dockerfile` for each service and the `docker-compose.yml` file as specified, including the secure port bindings.
    *   **Then**: Running `docker-compose up` will build and start both services, making them available for local development.

#### AC3: A CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) starts on every push, installs dependencies, and runs linters for both projects.

**Coverage: FULL**

*   **Task Mapping**: `Setup Pipeline di CI di Base (AC: 3)`
    *   **Given**: The monorepo is pushed to a GitHub repository.
    *   **When**: The developer creates the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file with the specified steps (checkout, setup, install, lint).
    *   **Then**: Any subsequent push to `main` or `develop` will trigger the workflow, which will validate the code quality by running the linters.

#### AC4: The React app shows a placeholder page.

**Coverage: FULL**

*   **Task Mapping**: `Inizializzazione Progetto Frontend (AC: 4)`
    *   **Given**: The monorepo structure exists.
    *   **When**: The developer creates a new Vite/React application in `apps/web` and implements the simple `App.tsx` placeholder component.
    *   **Then**: When the frontend service is started, it will render the specified placeholder message.

#### AC5: The FastAPI backend exposes a health-check endpoint.

**Coverage: FULL**

*   **Task Mapping**: `Inizializzazione Progetto Backend (AC: 5)`
    *   **Given**: The monorepo structure exists.
    *   **When**: The developer initializes a Poetry project in `apps/api` and creates the `main.py` file with the `/health` endpoint.
    *   **Then**: When the backend service is started, the `GET /health` endpoint will be available and return `{"status": "ok"}`.

### Critical Gaps

- **None.** The plan is comprehensive and covers all requirements.

### Test Design Recommendations

- For this scaffolding story, the "tests" are the successful execution of the setup tasks.
- It is recommended to add an automated smoke test to the CI pipeline in a future story. This test would run after the `docker-compose up` step (or its equivalent in CI) and would:
    1.  Make an HTTP request to the backend's `/health` endpoint to verify it returns a 200 OK.
    2.  Make an HTTP request to the frontend's root URL to verify it returns a 200 OK and contains the placeholder text.
