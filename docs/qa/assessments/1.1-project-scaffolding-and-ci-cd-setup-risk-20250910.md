# Risk Profile: Story 1.1 - Project Scaffolding & CI/CD Setup

Date: 2025-09-10
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 4
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 0
- **Overall Story Risk Score: 90/100 (Low Risk)**

This story has a low-risk profile, as it focuses on standard project scaffolding and CI setup. The risks identified are primarily operational and technical, and are well-mitigated by the story's core tasks, such as using Docker for environment consistency.

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

- **None.**

| **TECH-001** | Inconsistent Dev Environments    | Technical   | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   | Use Docker and `docker-compose` as planned; Pin tool versions (`.nvmrc`, etc.).      |
| **OPS-001**  | CI Pipeline Flakiness            | Operational | Medium (2)  | Low (1)    | 2     | Low      | Use standard, well-maintained GitHub Actions; Keep the initial pipeline simple.      |
| **TECH-002** | Configuration Drift              | Technical   | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      | Keep all configuration as code; Periodically review and update dependencies.     |
| **SEC-001**  | Unintentionally Exposed Ports    | Security    | Low (1)     | Low (1)    | 1     | Minimal  | Explicitly bind service ports to `127.0.0.1` in `docker-compose.yml`.           |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

Since this is a non-functional scaffolding story, traditional testing is not the focus. Validation should be on the integrity of the setup.

### Priority 1: Environment Validation

- **Manual Validation**: Have multiple developers on different machines run `docker-compose up` to confirm the environment starts consistently.
- **CI Pipeline Validation**: Confirm that the CI pipeline triggers on push and that the linting steps pass or fail correctly based on code quality.
- **Hot-Reloading Test**: Verify that changes made to frontend and backend source code on the host machine are reflected inside the running containers without a manual restart.

### Priority 2: Endpoint/UI Validation

- **Health-Check Test**: A simple `curl` or automated HTTP request in the CI pipeline to the backend's `/health` endpoint after the service starts.
- **Placeholder UI Test**: A manual check to ensure the frontend's placeholder page loads correctly in a browser.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All identified risks have straightforward mitigations that should be implemented as part of the story. No risks require deferral.

### Accepted Risks

- **None.** The residual risk after implementing mitigations is minimal and acceptable.

## Monitoring Requirements

- **CI Pipeline Monitoring**: Configure GitHub Actions to send notifications (e.g., via Slack or email) on pipeline failures for the `main` and `develop` branches.
- No application-level monitoring is required for this story.
