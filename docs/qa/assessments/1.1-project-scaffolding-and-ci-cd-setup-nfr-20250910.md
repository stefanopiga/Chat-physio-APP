# NFR Assessment: 1.1 - Project Scaffolding & CI/CD Setup

Date: 2025-09-10
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary

- **Security**: PASS - The foundational choices (Docker, secure port binding) establish a secure baseline.
- **Performance**: PASS - The selected tech stack (Vite, FastAPI) is modern and performant.
- **Reliability**: PASS - The core goal of the story is to create a reliable development and integration environment.
- **Maintainability**: PASS - The monorepo structure, linters, and clear project separation are excellent for long-term maintainability.

## Assessment Details

### 1. Security

**Status: PASS**

- **Evidence**:
    - Containerization with Docker isolates services.
    - The task to bind ports to `127.0.0.1` in `docker-compose.yml` prevents accidental network exposure, a critical security measure.
- **Notes**: While no application-level security exists yet, the infrastructure plan adheres to security best practices for a development environment. The CI pipeline provides a future entry point for automated security scanning tools (SAST).

### 2. Performance

**Status: PASS**

- **Evidence**:
    - The choice of `Vite` for the frontend and `FastAPI` for the backend are known for their high performance and fast development cycles.
    - Docker provides a consistent performance baseline across all developer machines.
- **Notes**: Application performance is not applicable at this stage. The chosen tools provide a strong foundation for building a performant application.

### 3. Reliability

**Status: PASS**

- **Evidence**:
    - `docker-compose` ensures that the local development environment is consistent and reproducible for all team members, reducing "it works on my machine" issues.
    - The GitHub Actions CI pipeline provides an automated, reliable check on every push, ensuring that broken code (at least from a linting perspective) is caught early.
    - The backend health-check endpoint is a foundational piece for future monitoring and reliability checks.
- **Notes**: The entire story is focused on establishing a reliable foundation for future work.

### 4. Maintainability

**Status: PASS**

- **Evidence**:
    - The `pnpm workspaces` monorepo structure is a clean, modern approach that promotes code sharing and organized dependency management.
    - The clear separation of concerns between `/apps/web` and `/apps/api` is excellent.
    - The mandatory inclusion of linters (`ESLint`, `Ruff`) in the CI pipeline enforces a consistent code style from day one, which is crucial for long-term maintainability.
- **Notes**: The project structure and automated quality checks are aligned with best practices for creating a maintainable codebase.

## Critical Issues

- **None.**

## Quick Wins

- No immediate actions are required as this is a foundational story. Future stories should build upon this strong NFR foundation.
