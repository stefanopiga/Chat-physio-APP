# Decision fields
gate: "CONCERNS"
status_reason: "High risks identified for documentation changes (secrets leakage, unsafe/broken commands, onboarding gaps/docs drift). Proceed with mitigations: add CI link checker and secret scanning, validate Quick Start on fresh clone, enforce .gitignore compliance evidence, and include explicit 'no secrets' note."
