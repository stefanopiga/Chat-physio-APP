  notes: |
    TRACEABILITY SUMMARY:
    - All 10 ACs mapped to tests or verification
    - Unit tests: 34/34 PASSED (100% success rate, 29.26s execution)
    - Integration tests: 10 IMPLEMENTED, structure complete, infrastructure blocking execution
    - Critical gap: E2E tests not executable (requires 8h infrastructure setup)
    - Medium gaps: Real file validation AC3/AC4 (requires fixture preparation)

    POSITIVE INDICATORS:
    - Every AC has test coverage or verification
    - Critical paths multi-level coverage (unit + integration structure)
    - Edge cases explicitly covered (case-insensitive, encoding fallback, error handling)
    - Clear Given-When-Then documentation for all scenarios

    P0 ACTIONS:
    - Manual E2E validation (acceptable short-term)
    - Path sanitization test (2h)
    - Rate limiter validation test (2h)

    P1 ACTIONS:
    - Integration test infrastructure setup (8h)
    - Image/table extraction real file tests (8h)
    - Performance load test (3h)

# NFR validation requirements (Updated 2025-10-07 - Post-Implementation)
nfr_validation:
  _assessed: [security, performance, reliability, maintainability]
  _assessment_date: "2025-10-07"
  _quality_score: 80 # Revised from initial 65 - implementation complete, P0 fixes required

  security:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Rate limiting annotated but not verified in tests. Path traversal risk: source_path from metadata unsanitized. Input validation partial: no magic bytes validation, extension-only detection. Must-fix: path sanitization (1h), rate limiter test (2h). OpenAI API key management verified secure (env vars)."

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All targets documented and implemented. Batch optimization 100 texts (OpenAI best practice). Timing metrics operational (embedding_ms, supabase_insert_ms, total_ms). Targets: <60s total pipeline for 50-page doc. Empirical validation pending (acceptable post-deploy). Recommendation: verify pgvector index on document_chunks.embedding."

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "EXCELLENT: Retry logic with tenacity exponential backoff (2s-60s, max 5 attempts) implemented. Error handling robust: separate paths for AuthenticationError (no retry) vs transient errors. Celery retry config verified (max_retries: 5). Troubleshooting guide complete (447 lines). Minor note: explicit timeout handling recommended for defense-in-depth (non-critical)."

  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Test coverage 46% vs 80% target (-34pp gap). Unit tests excellent: 34/34 PASSED in 29.26s. Integration tests 10 implemented but SKIPPED (infrastructure pending: test DB + OpenAI key). Code structure modular, type hints complete, docstrings detailed. Must-fix: increase coverage 46% → 70% (8h)."

# Additional context
notes: |
  Story 2.5 completes RAG pipeline with intelligent preprocessing:
  - Enhanced file type detection (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
  - PyMuPDF extraction for images/tables
  - Domain-specific classification (8 fisioterapic categories)
  - Robust batch embedding with retry logic
  - End-to-end pipeline monitoring

  PRIMARY CONCERNS:
  1. Production issue active: 121 chunks with NULL embeddings
  2. Celery worker not operational - async processing blocked
  3. OpenAI rate limiting risk on large document batches

  GATE DECISION RATIONALE:
  - CONCERNS status appropriate: critical risks have defined mitigations
  - NOT FAIL: clear implementation path, no architectural blockers
  - NOT PASS: critical issues must be resolved before production

  TIMELINE ESTIMATE: 2-3 sprint days for critical mitigations + testing

  DEPENDENCIES:
  - Stories 2.1-2.4 completed (prerequisite pipeline stages)
  - OpenAI API access operational
  - Supabase pgvector configured
  - Redis available for Celery broker
