    notes: |
      Story 5.4.2 è ready for merge con implementazione completa e 0 FK errors achieved.

      Key Achievements:
      - FK errors: 15 → 0 (100% elimination)
      - Test passed: 14 → 28 (+100%)
      - Test stability: 0 flakiness in 3 runs
      - Test isolation: Unique UUID per instance
      - Under budget: 8h actual vs 8-12h estimated

      Pass rate 75.7% (28/37 FK subset) < target 90% dovuto a 9 API logic bugs (non FK-related).
      Recommendation: Story 5.4.3 for API fixes (non-blocking for 5.4.2 merge).

      Green light for Story 2.6: FK infrastructure stable, no blocking issues.
